# ðŸ‘‰ Day 77 Challenge

Today's challenge is to set up a simple template for a blog.

Your template should:

1. Have a space for a heading
2. Have a space for today's date
3. Have a space for the text.

- Now write two different blog entries and serve them on two different endpoints.
- The blog entries should both use the same template, and have shortened redirects to their URLs.
    
Example:

![](resources/06_challenge1.png)
<details> <summary> ðŸ’¡ Hints </summary>
  
- Don't forget `f= open()` and `f.read()` to get the HTML into python from your trmplate page file.

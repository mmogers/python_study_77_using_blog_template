## Common Error 1

ðŸ‘‰ What's the problem here?

```python
from flask import Flask, redirect

@app.route('/77')
def seventySeven():
redirect("https://replit.com/@DavidAtReplit/Day-077-Solution#main.py")
```

I've missed the `return` before `redirect` which will create a TypeError.

```python
from flask import Flask, redirect

@app.route('/77')
def seventySeven():
  return redirect("https://replit.com/@DavidAtReplit/Day-077-Solution#main.py")
```

## Common Error 2

ðŸ‘‰ What's the problem here?
```python
@app.route('/56')
def fiftySix():
  myName = "Dave"
  title = "Day 56 Solution"
  text = "So, day 56 was all about using csv reading and file and folder manipulation to make 100 files in dozens of folders. This was tricky because the names of the folders and files were based on the top 100 streaming songs and so weren't simple to encode."
  image = "56.png"
  link = "https://replit.com/@DavidAtReplit/Day-056-Solution#main.py"
  
  page = ""
  f = open("template/portfolio.html", "r")
  page = f.read()
  f.close()
  page.replace("{name}", myName)
  page.replace("{title}", title)
  page.replace("{text}", text)
  page.replace("{image}", image)
  page.replace("{link}", link)
  page.replace("a", link)
  return page
```

The problem is with the last `replace`. It will replace every instance of 'a' in the page with the stored hyperlink. This is because I've not used the curly braces.

```python
@app.route('/56')
def fiftySix():
  myName = "Dave"
  title = "Day 56 Solution"
  text = "So, day 56 was all about using csv reading and file and folder manipulation to make 100 files in dozens of folders. This was tricky because the names of the folders and files were based on the top 100 streaming songs and so weren't simple to encode."
  image = "56.png"
  link = "https://replit.com/@DavidAtReplit/Day-056-Solution#main.py"
  
  page = ""
  f = open("template/portfolio.html", "r")
  page = f.read()
  f.close()
  page.replace("{name}", myName)
  page.replace("{title}", title)
  page.replace("{text}", text)
  page.replace("{image}", image)
  page.replace("{link}", link)
  page.replace("{a}", link)
  return page
```
